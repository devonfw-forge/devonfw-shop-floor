## Known issues

### When I run the script, I receive the following error message:
```diff
- deploy-app.sh: line 2: $'\r': command not found
- deploy-app.sh: line 4: syntax error near unexpected token `$'\r''
```
It is because the script has been edited in windows, and the end line in windows is \r\n but in linux \r don't exist. To solve it execute the next command:
```
sed -i 's/\r$//' filename
```
